							<h3>How does cryptocurrency enable economic freedom? </h3>		
					<p>“Our central argument is that higher acceptance and use of cryptocurrency would promote global economic freedom because cryptocurrency addresses many of the flaws in the present financial system that limit economic freedom.”</p>

                    <p><b> One question that we often hear is “How does cryptocurrency create more economic freedom in the world?” This is a great question, so I wanted to share my thoughts with all of you </b></p>
                    
                    <h3>So first of all what is economic freedom?</h3>
                    <p>It measures people's rights to govern their own labour and property in each country and throughout the world. While our economy is becoming increasingly global, the government of any one country has enormous power over the financial and economic liberties of its citizens.</p>
                    <p> Low economic freedom in a country is generally owing to mismanagement (poor monetary and fiscal policies) or just substandard infrastructure, rather than intentional conduct (e.g., fraud, tyranny, etc.).</p>
                
                    <h3>Cryptocurrency and economic freedom</h3>
                    <p>The challenge is: How can we create a global economy in which everybody with an internet connection can participate, property rights are respected, and money retains its value? The answer is cryptocurrency. Although cryptocurrency cannot directly enhance every aspect of economic liberty (for example, tax policy and government expenditures), it can improve the majority of the underlying factors (see below).</p>
                    <p> <b> Why is crypto so uniquely positioned to increase economic freedom? Because it has these inherent properties:</b></p>
                    <table class="table">
                        <tr>
                            <th>Market Openness</th>
                            <th>Regulatory Efficiency</th>
                            <th>Rule of Law</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Trade freedom</td>
                            <td>Business freedom</td>
                            <td>Property rights</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Investment freedom</td>
                            <td>Monetary freedom</td>
                            <td> </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Financial freedom</td>
                            <td>Labor freedom </td>
                            <td> </td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                
                
                    <h3>Crypto-currency is an open, global network</h3>
                    <p>Cryptocurrency networks are decentralised, reducing geographical constraints. It enables everyone in the world to transact on shared networks in the same manner that they may communicate on the internet. More crucially, these networks are independent of governments, which may use their monetary systems to stifle economic freedom and economic prosperity. This design approach improves trade freedom, investment freedom, financial freedom, and monetary freedom, resulting in more open markets.</p>

                    <h3>Crypto-currency enforces property rights</h3>
                    <p>Property rights enable individuals to save money, increase their wealth, and prepare for the future because they know the products of their labor are protected from arbitrary seizure or theft. Prior to crypto, your belief in property rights was determined by your trust in your government and its adherence to the rule of law. With cryptocurrency, anybody may acquire and develop their money without the intrusion of trusted third parties like as a government or a bank, or the risk of their riches being readily confiscated. Property rights include the power to enter into contractual agreements. A contract has minimal value in some parts of the globe since its enforcement is uncertain. Smart contracts shift enforcement away from the courts and onto the blockchain, allowing for profits from specialization and economic exchange.</p>

                    <h3>Crypto-currency is unbiased</h3>
                    <p>Crypto networks are frequently pseudonymous (or even anonymous). They are unconcerned with where you reside, your colour or gender, or who you voted for in the past election. They are fundamentally open and fair, in contrast to the present financial system. Anyone with an internet connection may establish a wallet, receive payments in cryptocurrency, spend cryptocurrency, and accumulate cryptocurrency riches. Service providers, like as Kinney Pay, have compliance systems in place as needed by law, but we do not control access to all crypto and do not manage the network. If we make a wrong judgement or are coerced into terrible regulation, anyone may access crypto networks through other providers.</p>

                    <h3>Crypto-currency enables mobility</h3>
                    <p>As I previously said, there are crucial aspects of economic liberty that cryptocurrency cannot directly benefit (e.g., government integrity, tax policies, fiscal health, etc.). However, cryptocurrency creates the conditions for mobility by lowering switching costs, allowing people to accumulate money while also transporting it across borders. By considerably lowering the barriers to emigration / leave and so expanding economic freedom, cryptocurrency is the ultimate manifestation of individual power.</p>
